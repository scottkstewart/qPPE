(Functionality is still a bit shaky -- daemon handling is broken and everything is still poorly tested, but it kinda works)

GUI Extension of Phoenix-parse-email based on PyQt -- meant to remove any interaction with studentvue. Basically just displays data as well/customizably as possible, even without constant connection. Don't trust point totals too much if your class includes formative grades; Studentvue is bad about displaying weights/totals, so accurate totals are lost for weighted classes.
